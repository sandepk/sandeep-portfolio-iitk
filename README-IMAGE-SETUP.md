# Adding Your Profile Image

To add your profile image to the portfolio:

1. **Save your image** as `profile-image.jpg` in the `public` folder
2. **Image specifications:**
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio)
   - The image will be automatically cropped to a circle and resized

3. **Alternative file names:**
   If you prefer a different filename, you can also use:
   - `profile-image.png`
   - `profile-image.webp`
   - `sandeep-profile.jpg`

4. **Image placement:**
   - The image will appear prominently at the top of your hero section
   - It will be displayed as a circular profile picture with a subtle border and shadow
   - Hover effects will make it slightly larger for an interactive feel

5. **Fallback:**
   - If no image is found, a professional placeholder will be displayed automatically

## Quick Setup:
```bash
# Copy your image to the public folder
cp /path/to/your/image.jpg public/profile-image.jpg
```

Your portfolio will now display your professional photo, making it more personal and engaging for visitors!
